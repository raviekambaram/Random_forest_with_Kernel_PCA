This Model is built for a major education website that handles massive 
open online courses(MOOCs). Users register for a particular course and 
would be analyzed according to their grades scored at the end of each 
semester. In this project we mainly concentrate on predicting the grades 
of the students who would be taking up the course in the upcoming semester 
with various analysis factors.
